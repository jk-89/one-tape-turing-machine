## Description

Write a Python procedure `eliminateInputTape(machine)`. As a parameter it takes a Turing machine with a read-only input tape and with one working tape. The format of the Turing machine should be as in the file `turingPython.ipynb`.
The procedure should return a Turing machine without the read-only input tape (i.e., with `onlyWorkTape` set to `True`).

The new machine should accept the same input words as the original one. Make sure that the generated machine can be executed by the interpreter in `turingPython.ipynb`. Moreover, your solution should not only be correct, but also work in a reasonable time, produce Turing machines working in reasonable time, etc.
